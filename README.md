# Hotel_booking_prediction
This project focuses on predicting whether a hotel booking will be canceled or not, using machine learning techniques. Leveraging a real-world dataset, it explores various data preprocessing steps, feature engineering, visualization, and classification algorithms to build an accurate predictive model.
üìå Objectives
Analyze booking patterns to understand key factors contributing to cancellations.
Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical features.
Build and evaluate classification models to predict booking cancellations.
Provide actionable insights to hotel management to reduce cancellation rates and optimize resources.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
Jupyter Notebook

üìä Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations.
Correlation analysis and feature selection.
Data transformation including encoding, scaling, and splitting.
Model training and evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.
